# How many BehavioralPatterns have you used ? 


Behavioral patterns in software design are a category of design patterns that focus on the interaction and communication between objects and classes. These patterns capture the behavior and communication patterns among objects, providing solutions for organizing, managing, and coordinating their interactions. Here are some commonly recognized behavioral patterns:

1. Observer Pattern: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, where changes in one object trigger automatic updates to other dependent objects.

2. Strategy Pattern: Enables the selection of an algorithm or behavior at runtime from a family of interchangeable algorithms. It encapsulates each algorithm and makes them interchangeable.

3. Command Pattern: Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing parameterization of clients with different requests, queueing or logging requests, and supporting undoable operations.

4. Template Method Pattern: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class but allows subclasses to override certain steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.

5. Iterator Pattern: Provides a way to access elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

6. State Pattern: Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. It appears as if the object changed its class.

7. Chain of Responsibility Pattern: Creates a chain of objects, where each object has a chance to handle a request or pass it to the next object in the chain until the request is handled or reaches the end of the chain.

8. Interpreter Pattern: Defines a representation of grammar and interprets sentences in that language.

9. Visitor Pattern: Defines a new operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure without changing the classes of the elements themselves.

10. Memento Pattern: Captures and externalizes an object's internal state so that it can be restored later, without violating encapsulation.

These patterns help in achieving various goals, such as improving code reusability, flexibility, modularity, and maintainability. They provide solutions to common problems encountered in software design, allowing developers to design systems that are easier to understand, extend, and modify.
